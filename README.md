# Learning Rust

Documenting my learning journey through [24 days from Node.js to Rust](https://vino.dev/blog/node-to-rust-day-1-rustup/)

## Day 1

- install rust via `rustup` https://rustup.rs/
- installed rustup completions via https://github.com/pkulev/zsh-rustup-completion
- learned about rust-toolchain.toml for specifying project deps

## Day 2

- learned about cargo
- init repo with `cargo init`
- installed `cargo-edit` to add `add`, `rm`, `upgrade`, and `set-version` commands
- installed `just` as a better version of make
- learned about workspace and `cargo-workspace` but did not install
- learned about macros and `cargo-expand` to reveal the compiled code
- learned about `tomlq` as a `jq` for toml files
